# Sorting Algos in C
Just some sorting algos in C so I can practice implementing stuff.

Note: "Array", "Buffer", and "List" are used interchangeably since they're sort of all the same things.

## Warning
All of these implementations are probably not that efficient or the best. I might have even made some mistakes in the implementation.  
As stated above, these sorting algos are mainly for me to refer back to and practice my skillz.

## TODO
Add a table with all Big-O time complexities of algos and how they work

Also add pseudocode for algos and step by step diagram maybe for small array.
E.g. [ 9 ] [ 8 ] [ 4 ] [ 3 ] [ 1 ] [ 7 ] [ 2 ] [ 6 ] [ 5 ] [ 0 ]
